## 1. How to install and run C/C++ ?

### Installation ->
1. Create a ```C/C++``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/LeetCode-Adi.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
4. Run ``` pip3 install gcc ```.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

### Usage ->
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

- To run any program (with <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -lm```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- Then type ``` ./a.out```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

## 2. How to install and run python ?

### Installation ->
1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/LeetCode-Adi.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
4. Go to the [Python website.](https://www.python.org/)
5. Download the software.
6. Install it according to the guide.
7. Open terminal and type ```python --version``` to see whether it is properly installed or not.
8. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts. 


### Usage ->
- To run any python program, run ``` python filename.py```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- If the above command doesn't work, then run ``` python3 filename.py```, where again filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
