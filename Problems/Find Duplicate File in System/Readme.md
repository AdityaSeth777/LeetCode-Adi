The typing module is imported to use the List type hint for the paths input parameter and the return type hint for the findDuplicate method.

The collections module is imported to use the defaultdict class, which is a subclass of the built-in dict class that provides a default value for keys that have not been set yet.

The Solution class is defined, which contains the findDuplicate method that takes a list of strings called paths as input and returns a list of lists of strings representing the groups of duplicate file paths.

Inside the findDuplicate method, a defaultdict called content_to_path is created to store the file paths for each file content. The default value for a key is an empty list.

The paths input list is iterated over using a for loop, and each path is split into a directory string and a list of files strings.

Another for loop is used to iterate over each file string in the files list. Each file string is split into a filename string and a content string using the split method.

The content string is modified by removing the closing parenthesis character at the end of the string using slicing.

The full file path is constructed by concatenating the directory string, the forward slash character ("/"), and the filename string.

The full_path string is appended to the list of file paths for the corresponding content key in the content_to_path dictionary.

The findDuplicate method returns a list comprehension that iterates over each group of file paths in the content_to_path dictionary and filters out any groups that have less than 2 file paths, i.e., groups with a single file are not included in the result.

Overall, the code uses a dictionary to group together file paths with the same content, and then returns only the groups with more than one file path. This satisfies the requirement of finding all duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths.
