This is a Python function that calculates the difference between the product of the digits and the sum of the digits of a given integer.

The function subtractProductAndSum takes an integer n as input and returns an integer representing the difference between the product of the digits and the sum of the digits.

The function starts by converting the integer n to a string using the str() function, and then splits the string into a list of digits using a list comprehension that converts each character in the string to an integer using the int() function.

Then, the function calculates the product and sum of the digits using a for loop that iterates over each digit in the digits list. The product and summation are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively, and are updated at each iteration by multiplying the product with the current digit, and adding the current digit to the summation.

Finally, the function returns the difference between the product and sum of the digits, which is calculated as product - summation.

Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to calculate the difference between the product and sum of the digits of an integer using string manipulation and simple arithmetic operations.
