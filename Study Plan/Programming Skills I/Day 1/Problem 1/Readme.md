This code defines a function called countOdds that takes two integer arguments low and high and returns the number of odd integers between low and high, inclusive.

The first condition in the function checks if both low and high are odd. If they are, the function calculates the number of odd integers between low and high using the formula (high - low) // 2 + 1 and returns the result. Here, // is the floor division operator that returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the quotient of the division.

The second condition in the function checks if both low and high are even. If they are, the function calculates the number of odd integers between low and high using the formula (high - low) // 2 and returns the result.

The third condition in the function checks if low is even and high is odd or if low is odd and high is even. If either of these conditions is true, the function calculates the number of odd integers between low and high using the formula (high - low + 1) // 2. The +1 in the formula is added to account for the fact that one of the endpoints (low or high) is odd, which means that there is one additional odd integer to include in the count.

If none of the above conditions is true, the function returns 0, as there are no odd integers between low and high.
