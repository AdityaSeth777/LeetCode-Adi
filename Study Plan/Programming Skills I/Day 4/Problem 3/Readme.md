The isHappy function takes a positive integer n as input and returns True if n is a happy number, and False otherwise.

The function first defines a helper function sum_of_squares(num) that takes a number as input and returns the sum of the squares of its digits. This function is used to replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in each iteration of the algorithm.

The function then initializes a set seen to keep track of the numbers encountered during the iteration. It repeatedly replaces the input number n by the sum of the squares of its digits using the sum_of_squares function until either it reaches 1 (which means n is a happy number) or it enters a cycle of numbers (which means n is not a happy number). The set seen is used to check if n has already been encountered during the iteration. If n is not in seen, it is added to the set. If n is already in seen, the function enters a cycle and returns False.

If n reaches 1 during the iteration, the function returns True.
