Problem -> <https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/submissions/913111842/>


Here's how the code works:

First, we check if s1 and s2 are already equal. If they are, we return True.

Next, we find the first index where s1 and s2 differ. If there is no difference, we can't make them equal with a single swap, so we return False. If there is more than one difference, we can't make them equal with a single swap either, so we return False.

We then check if swapping the characters at index_diff in s1 would make s1 equal to s2. To do this, we look for another index i where s1[i] == s2[index_diff] and s2[i] == s1[index_diff]. If we find such an index i, we can swap the characters at index_diff and i in s1 to make it equal to s2, so we return True. If we don't find such an index i, we can't make them equal with a single swap, so we return False.

Note that the code assumes that s1 and s2 have the same length. If they don't, we should add a check for that too.
