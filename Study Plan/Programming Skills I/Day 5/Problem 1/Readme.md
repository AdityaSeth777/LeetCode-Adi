Problem -> <https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/?envType=study-plan&id=programming-skills-i>


The solution defines a class called Solution with a method called preorder, which takes the root node of the n-ary tree as input and returns a list of integers. The function initializes an empty list called ans to store the node values.

The solution also defines a helper function called helper, which performs the recursive preorder traversal of the tree. The helper function takes a single argument curr, which represents the current node being processed during the traversal. The nonlocal keyword is used to indicate that the ans variable being referred to is the one declared in the outer scope, i.e., the preorder method.

The helper function checks if the current node curr exists. If it does, it appends the value of curr to the ans list. Then, it iterates over the children of curr using a for loop and recursively calls the helper function on each child node.

The preorder method calls the helper function with the root node of the tree as the initial value of curr. Finally, the preorder method returns the ans list containing the node values in the preorder traversal order.

In summary, this solution performs a recursive preorder traversal of the n-ary tree using a helper function and stores the node values in a list. The helper function recursively traverses each child of the current node and appends the node values to the list in the preorder traversal order.
