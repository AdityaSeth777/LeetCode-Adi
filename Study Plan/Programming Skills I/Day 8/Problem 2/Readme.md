Problem -> <https://leetcode.com/problems/goal-parser-interpretation/?envType=study-plan&id=programming-skills-i>

Here, we initialize an empty string interpreted_str to store the interpreted command and a pointer i to 0 to iterate through the string command.

We then loop through the string using the pointer and check each character to determine its interpretation. If the character is "G", we add the string "G" to interpreted_str and increment the pointer by 1. If the character is "(", we check the next character to determine if it is ")" or "a". If it is ")", we add the string "o" to interpreted_str and increment the pointer by 2. If it is "a", we add the string "al" to interpreted_str and increment the pointer by 4.

After the loop, we return interpreted_str as the answer to the problem. This code should correctly interpret the given command string and return its interpretation according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
