Problem -> <https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/?envType=study-plan&id=programming-skills-i>


Here, we first initialize a variable max_wealth to 0. Then, we loop through each customer in the accounts list and compute their wealth by summing up the values in their respective bank accounts using the built-in sum function. We then update the max_wealth variable with the maximum of its current value and the wealth of the current customer using the built-in max function.

Finally, we return the max_wealth variable as the answer to the problem. This code should correctly find the maximum wealth of the richest customer in the given accounts list.
