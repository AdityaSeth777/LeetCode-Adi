Question -> https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/submissions/910708191/

Here's an explanation of the code:

First, we import the List class from the typing module to define the type of the input argument time as a list of integers, and the type of the input argument totalTrips as an integer.

We then define a class called Solution with a method called minimumTime that takes time and totalTrips as input arguments and returns an integer.

In the first line of the minimumTime method, we initialize the left and right pointers for binary search as 0 and the maximum time taken by any bus multiplied by totalTrips, respectively.

We then enter a while loop that continues until the left and right pointers converge. In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint of the left and right pointers using integer division and assign it to the variable mid.

Inside the loop, we initialize a variable called trips to 0, which will keep track of the total number of trips made by all the buses combined at time mid. We then loop through the list time and for each bus, we calculate the number of trips that it can make at time mid by dividing mid by the time taken by the bus and rounding down to the nearest integer. We add this value to trips.

If the total number of trips made by all the buses combined at time mid is greater than or equal to totalTrips, we break out of the loop because we have found a valid solution. Otherwise, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

After the loop ends, if the total number of trips made by all the buses combined at the midpoint mid is greater than or equal to totalTrips, we update the right pointer to mid. This is because we want to find the minimum possible time at which all the buses can complete at least totalTrips trips. Otherwise, we update the left pointer to mid + 1, because we know that the minimum possible time cannot be less than mid + 1.

Finally, once the left and right pointers converge, the final value of left will be the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips. We return this value as the answer.
