This is the implementation of the Solution class that returns a random node's value from a singly linked list.

In the __init__ method, the constructor takes in the head of the linked list and initializes it as an instance variable self.head.

In the getRandom method, a variable count is initialized to keep track of the number of nodes visited so far. A variable result is initialized to None which will later store the value of the randomly selected node. A pointer curr is initialized to the head of the linked list.

The method then enters a loop that traverses the linked list while updating the count for each node visited. For each node visited, a random integer between 1 and the current count (inclusive) is generated using the random.randint() function. If the generated random integer is 1, then the result variable is updated with the value of the current node.

By selecting a random integer between 1 and the count, each node in the linked list has an equal probability of being selected as the random node, since the probability of selecting a node is 1/count.

At the end of the loop, the value of the result variable is returned, which is the value of the randomly selected node. If the linked list is empty, then the result variable will still be None and the method will return None as well.
