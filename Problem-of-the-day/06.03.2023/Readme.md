The given code implements a function findKthPositive that takes a vector arr of integers and an integer sum as input, and returns an integer that represents the sum-th positive integer missing from the arr.

The algorithm used in this function is as follows:

Append a very large value (here, 1000000) to the end of arr.
Initialize variables prev to 0 and ans to 0.
Loop through the elements of arr.
For each element, calculate the difference between the current element and prev and subtract 1 from it. This gives the number of missing integers between prev and the current element.
If the number of missing integers is less than sum, subtract this value from sum.
If the number of missing integers is greater than or equal to sum, calculate the answer as prev + sum and break out of the loop.
Update prev to the current element.
Remove the very large value appended to arr.
Return the answer.
In essence, the function keeps track of the number of missing integers between consecutive elements of arr, and subtracts this count from sum until the sum-th missing integer is found.
