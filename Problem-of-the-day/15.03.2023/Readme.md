Problem -> <https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/>


This is a C++ solution to determine if a given binary tree is a complete binary tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels except possibly the last level are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible on the last level.

The function isCompleteTree takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the binary tree is complete.

The function first initializes a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree. It pushes the root node to the queue and sets two variables, i and f, to 0. i represents the index of the current node, and f is a flag that is set when a node is encountered that has only one child or no children.

The function then enters into a loop where it dequeues the next node from the queue and performs the following checks:

If the flag f is set and the node is not null, it means that the binary tree is not complete as a node with a child has been encountered after a node with no children. So, the function returns false.
If the node is null, it means that the last level has not been completely filled yet. So, it sets the flag f to 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the node is not null, it pushes its left and right child nodes to the queue.
If the function reaches the end of the loop without returning false, it means that the binary tree is complete, and it returns true.

In summary, the function performs a level-order traversal of the binary tree and checks if it satisfies the conditions of a complete binary tree by using a flag f to keep track of whether the last level has been completely filled and by returning false as soon as a node with a child is encountered after a node with no children.
